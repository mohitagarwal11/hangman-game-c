# Hangman Game in C
A console-based Hangman game written in C.<br>
This project helped me apply and improve my understanding of arrays, loops, strings and basic logic in a fun and interactive way.<br>
<br>
## Game Concept<br>
You get a **hint**, and you have to guess the **hidden word** one letter at a time. You have **6 lives** to guess before the man gets hanged!<br>
Each wrong guess adds a part to the hangman drawing.<br>
<br>
## Features<br>
- Random word and hint generation<br>
- Letter-by-letter guessing logic<br>
- Prevention of duplicate guesses<br>
- Visual hangman drawing using ASCII art<br>
- Win/loss conditions with clear messages<br>
<br>
 ## Concepts Used<br>
- Arrays and Strings<br>
- Nested loops and conditional logic<br>
- Functions and modular code<br>
- Random number generation(rand)<br>
- Input handling and flushing buffer safely<br>
<br>
 ## Future Improvements<br>
- Allow user-defined word sets<br>
- Save scores or track performance<br>
- GUI version using C graphics or porting to Python<br>
