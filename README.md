# Hangman Game in C

A console-based Hangman game written in C.  
This project helped me apply and improve my understanding of arrays, loops, strings, and basic logic in a fun and interactive way.

<br>

##  Game Concept

You get a **hint**, and you have to guess the **hidden word** one letter at a time.  
You have **6 lives** to guess before the man gets hanged!  
Each wrong guess adds a part to the hangman drawing.

<br>

##  Features

- Random word and hint generation  
- Letter-by-letter guessing logic  
- Prevention of duplicate guesses  
- Visual hangman drawing using ASCII art  
- Win/loss conditions with clear messages

<br>

##  Concepts Used

- Arrays and Strings  
- Nested loops and conditional logic  
- Functions and modular code  
- Random number generation (rand)  
- Input handling and flushing buffer safely

<br>

##  Future Improvements

- Allow user-defined word sets  
- Save scores or track performance  
- GUI version using C graphics or porting to Python
